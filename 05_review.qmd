## Paper: Dynamic Predictions and Prospective Accuracy in Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data

Authors: Dimitris Rizopoulos Journal: Biometrics 67, 819–829, September 2011

Framework: Explores the joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data, focuses on assessing the predictive power of longitudinal markers for future event occurrences.

Motivating Example: Used real data on HIV infected patients’ CD4 cell count measurements.

Idea in new approach: In this paper, the authors have pursued a dual objective: firstly, to describe the methodology for estimating survival probabilities while considering the endogenous nature of longitudinal markers, and secondly, to evaluate the predictive accuracy of these markers in joint models. To estimate conditional survival probabilities, the authors introduced two estimators: one directly based on empirical Bayes estimates and maximum likelihood estimates, and another using a Monte Carlo approach. For assessing predictive accuracy, the estimates of sensitivity and specificity measures are derived under the joint modeling framework. Time-dependent ROC curves and AUCs are used to illustrate how the accuracy of the longitudinal marker changes over time. A discrimination index is proposed which offers a weighted average of AUCs to summarize information over the entire follow-up period.

Estimation: Focuses on estimating the effect of unobserved longitudinal covariates on the risk of an event. The survival model is defined using a relative risk model, and the reconstruction of the longitudinal history depends on a linear mixed-effects model to describe the subject-specific longitudinal evolutions. A maximum likelihood approach is used to estimate the joint models’ parameters. The log-likelihood function is maximized using standard numerical integration techniques such as Monte Carlo and Gaussian quadrature because of the computational difficulty of the log-likelihood function.

The expected survival probabilities for new subjects are conditioned on survival up to a specific time point. An asymptotic Bayesian formulation is introduced to derive the posterior expectation of these conditional survival probabilities which considers the variability of both maximum likelihood and empirical Bayes estimates. A Monte Carlo simulation method is proposed to estimate the conditional survival probabilities. The estimated survival probabilities are then used to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals. This method offers an accurate approach for estimating conditional survival probabilities while properly addressing the endogenous nature of the longitudinal measurements.

An ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) approach is introduced to assess the predictive ability of longitudinal biomarkers. Longitudinal marker values are used to create prediction rules to differentiate between high and low-risk patients. The choice of these rules is flexible and evaluated within the joint modeling framework. Sensitivity and specificity are calculated based on the defined prediction rules. ROC curves, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and dynamic AUC are used as metrics to assess the overall discrimination power of the longitudinal markers. A Monte Carlo simulation approach is used to estimate sensitivity and its standard error. Estimations of sensitivity and specificity are then used to construct ROC curves and to calculate AUC. This approach provides a robust method to assess the predictive performance of longitudinal biomarkers in dynamic studies.

Results: The AIDS dataset (focusing on the CD4 cell count measurements of patients) is used to estimate expected survival probabilities and evaluate the ability to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of death.

A joint model is fitted to incorporate both survival and longitudinal sub models. The regression coefficients are estimated using R (JM package). The analysis has estimated survival probabilities and confidence intervals for these probabilities for individual patients which showed how CD4 cell count changes affect survival estimates.

The ability of CD4 cell count to discriminate between patients using ROC curves is also explored and it is found that CD4 cell count has moderate discrimination power and there are minimal differences between the different time windows.

Discussions: Model misspecification could affect accuracy estimates, but the joint models tend to be robust against certain types of misspecifications. Further flexibility in model components, like the baseline risk function and error distribution, could enhance robustness. Models can be overfitted due to complexity of the models. Bootstrap approaches can be used to correct the overfitting. While the paper has focused on discrimination primarily, the authors acknowledged the importance of calibration in joint models.

## Paper: The R Package JMbayes for Fitting Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data Using MCMC

Authors: Dimitris Rizopoulos Journal: Journal of Statistical Software, August 2016, Volume 72, Issue 7

Framework: The paper introduces the R package JMbayes for fitting joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data under a Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.

Idea in new approach: The paper introduces several features that distinguish JMbayes from other software implementations for joint models. The package can handle different types of longitudinal outcomes, such as continuous, categorical, or censored, and provides various options for modeling the association between the longitudinal and survival processes. The package also offers tools for deriving and validating dynamic predictions for both outcomes. The paper discusses how to use JMbayes to derive individualized predictions for both the longitudinal and the event time outcomes and discusses about the techniques to combine predictions from different models using Bayesian model averaging.

Estimation: The paper presents the formulation of joint models, which consists of a generalized linear mixed effects model for the longitudinal outcome and a relative risk model for the time-to-event outcome. The baseline hazard function is approximated by B-splines, and the association between the two outcomes is calculated by a function of the subject-specific linear predictor of the longitudinal model. The paper also describes the prior distributions and the posterior distribution of the model parameters, and the numerical integration methods for the survival function. The paper discusses two methods for calculating dynamic predictions: the Bayesian method, which uses the posterior distribution of the parameters and the random effects, and the Monte Carlo simulation method, which uses the joint model to simulate future trajectories and event times.

Design and Implementation: The paper explains the design and implementation of the package JMbayes, which is similar to the package JM for fitting joint models under maximum likelihood. The main function of the package is jointModelBayes(), which accepts as arguments a linear mixed effects object and a Cox model object. The function uses an MCMC algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters and the random effects and provides several tools to check convergence and summarize the results. The function also allows for specifying different types of longitudinal outcomes, association structures, and baseline hazard functions. The paper also compares the speed and flexibility of JMbayes with other software implementations of joint models. The paper introduces a web interface that allows users to obtain dynamic predictions for new or existing patients, based on the joint model and the available data. The paper provides tools to assess the predictive performance of models in terms of discrimination and calibration, using measures such as the time-dependent AUC and expected prediction error. The paper also shows how to perform validation using cross-validation technique.

Motivating Example: The paper illustrates the use of JMbayes with the PBC data, a dataset on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease. The paper shows how to fit different types of joint models for the longitudinal serum bilirubin level and the time to transplantation or death, and how to compare and validate the fitted models. The results suggest that serum bilirubin is strongly associated with the risk of the event and that the joint models provide better predictions than the separate models for the longitudinal and survival outcomes.

Future Directions: The paper discusses some of the current limitations and challenges of JMbayes and some possible directions for future development. For example, the paper mentions the need for more efficient MCMC algorithms, the possibility of incorporating other types of longitudinal outcomes and the extension of joint models to handle multiple longitudinal outcomes and recurrent events.
